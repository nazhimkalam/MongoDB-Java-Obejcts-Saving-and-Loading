# MongoDB-Java-Obejcts-Saving-and-Loading

### * Import gson java driver package and mongo java driver package as well into the project

### * we use gson to convert the objects created into JSON strings to save in mongodb, because mongodb stores data in JSON format.

### * we use the mongo java driver so that we can work with mongodb using a java environment 

### * I am using the cloud to store the data, so I have created a cluster already.

### * Use mongo compass to view the records.
